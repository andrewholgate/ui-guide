		<h1>Layout</h1>
		<p>To create a great content page you have to keep a few things in mind. Those things are: <em>hierarchy</em>, <em>alignment</em> and <em>simplicity</em>. It's easy to do if you adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
		<ul class="notes">
			<li><strong>Content comes first.</strong> Before you start composing the layout of your page, please make sure you have your content ready. There's nothing more annoying than a set of styles which don't work with your content. Keep everything simple and neutral, to let the content stand out on its own.</li>
			<li><strong>Provide context.</strong> When creating a langing page, you need context that would back up the content and make it more prominent. This will help focus user's attention on that particular section, whether it's a title or an image, or maybe something else you have in mind.</li>
			<li><strong>Frame the page.</strong> Use our <a href="#">masthead pattern</a> to frame your page. It doesn't have to be exactly the same, as it refers to your content, but it will indicate that your content belongs to the same network, by using our primary branding colours.</li>
			<li><strong>Left-align content.</strong> All the regular content should be aligned to the left, unless it's intended for Arabic languages. This will help with making dense content structures less intimidating and easier to read.</li>
			<li><strong>Spacing is good.</strong> Give your content a bit of space; padding and margins around all elements helps your pages breathe, whether it's an article page or a contact form, elements need space to stay effective.</li>
			<li><strong>Provide focus.</strong> Show the visitor exactly what your intentions are. Provide only one primary call to action and make it front and center. If additional actions are needed, make sure they have less importance and are not crammed together.</li>
		</ul>
