### Headings
Headings are a useful tool to markup important sections of a given page, such as headlines, chapters, etc. Any heading elements may include links or anchors.

<div class="type-sizes headings">
  <h4 class="label">H1</h4>
  <h1 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h1>
  <h4 class="label">H2</h4>
  <h2 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h2>
  <h4 class="label">H3</h4>
  <h3 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h3>
  <h4 class="label">H4</h4>
  <h4 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h4>
  <h4 class="label">H5</h4>
  <h5 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h5>
  <h4 class="label">H6</h4>
  <h6 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h6>
</div>

### Links
Links are special elements that point reader to other places on the Web, therefore they have to stand out from other text. Use only meaningful text for your links; words such as "here", "click here" don't tell the reader where they lead.

<div class="preview paragraph">
  <p>The Zero Hunger Challenge, launched by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, encourages everyone - whether in government, business or civil society - to focus their energies on ending hunger in our lifetimes. By partnering with WFP and supporting its work, major global companies such as <a href="https://www.wfp.org/how-to-help/companies/partner/unilever">Unilever</a>, <a href="https://www.wfp.org/partners/private-sector/meet-our-partners/dsm">DSM</a> and <a href="https://www.wfp.org/about/partners/companies/meet-our-partners/mastercard">MasterCard</a> have already started to do this, joining with <a href="https://www.wfp.org/partners/governments"></a>governments</a> and civil society in the quest for zero hunger.</p>
</div>

### Blockquotes
Whenever you need to use a quote from another source on your page, use a `blockquote` tag.

<div class="preview paragraph">
  <blockquote>The Zero Hunger Challenge, launched by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, encourages everyone - whether in government, business or civil society - to focus their energies on ending hunger in our lifetimes. By partnering with WFP and supporting its work, major global companies such as Unilever, DSM and MasterCard have already started to do this, joining with governments and civil society in the quest for zero hunger.</blockquote>

### Lists
We have two types of lists for use within the body text: _ordered_ and _unordered_.

###### Ordered list
<div class="preview paragraph">
  <ol>
    <li>First list item.</li>
    <li>Second list item.</li>
    <li>Third list item.</li>
