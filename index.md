The World Food Programme’s Branding Guidance was published in 2009 and has now been effectively implemented across our organization, strengthening our brand image through consistent representation.

Building on this initiative, the World Food Programme’s User Interface Style Guide emphasizes WFP’s commitment and potential to establish and build our online brand.

This website contains a set of guidelines which are to be applied to all WFP digital products such as websites, web applications, internal systems and other. These guidelines were defined to help create, in an easy way, consistent and attractive user interfaces for WFP's properties.
