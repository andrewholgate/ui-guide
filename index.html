		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>The <em>World Food Programme’s Online Branding Guidance</em> was published in 2010 and is now effectively being implemented across our organization, strengthening our brand image through consistent representation.</p>
		<p>Building on this initiative, the <em>UI Style Guide</em> emphasizes WFP’s commitment and potential to establishing and building our brand presence through online outreach.</p>
		<p>This website contains a set of guidelines, which are to be used throughout all WFP digital channels, such as websites, web applications, internal systems and other, including digital documents. These guidelines are set for fellow content creators at WFP, to help them create consistent and beautiful content for WFP's properties in an easy way.</p>
		<p>To thrive online, it is essential to present a brand that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>focuses on <em>what we do</em>, rather than on <em>who we are</em>;</li>
	 		<li>emphasizes our place in a global community by being open to healthy debate or dialogue;</li>
			<li>is consistent but flexible, to adjust to the fast-changing requirements of online media.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The UI Style Guide serves as an important roadmap. However, we leave room for approved exceptions based on unanticipated needs and shifting best practices online.</p>
