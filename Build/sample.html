<h2>SCOPE Platform is &lsquo;Future of WFP&rsquo; – This Project in Malawi Shows Why</h2>

<p><em>Concerted efforts to tackle alarmingly high rates of stunting in Malawi are being boosted by an innovative system that allows digital, real-time tracking of beneficiaries. The Prevention of Stunting Project – in the central Ntchisi District – is targeting all children under two years old and their mothers, during a critical &#8220;window of opportunity&#8221; in the first 1,000 days of the child&#8217;s life.&nbsp;</em><em>One of the Project&#8217;s key elements is <a href="http://go.wfp.org/web/scope/">WFP&#8217;s SCOPE platform</a>, which has registered 22,000 people and provided them with cards featuring their photo and a barcode.</em> <em>Luca Molinas,</em> <em>Monitoring and Evaluation Officer for the project funded by the Children&#8217;s Investment Fund Foundation, tells us more about SCOPE.</em></p>
<p>We work with special field-ready laptops – which are durable, dust proof and readable in bright light – and with solar-powered generators. We put information into the system and distribute barcoded ID cards that allow us to track individual beneficiaries. This allows for up-to-the-minute monitoring of their participation and progress in the project&nbsp;<em>–</em>&nbsp;which includes&nbsp;WFP providing&nbsp;a nutrient supplement called Nutributter, containing&nbsp;micronutrients essential for growth and good health.</p>

<p>We are able to use SCOPE to monitor activities even in our remote areas, because of its ability to operate offline. This means we can work everywhere despite weak connectivity. After inputting information in the field, the offline data is synchronized with a centralized server and the data is available online to authorized personnel, so that we can track progress in real time.</p>
<h3>&#8216;Many advantages of using SCOPE have emerged&#8217;</h3>
<p>The Country Office has registered a further 35,000 beneficiaries using SCOPE, for emergency cash transfers, and is working with other partners to promote national development of real-time monitoring systems.</p>
<p>Many advantages of using SCOPE have emerged over the past four months that are enabling us to work better and with more reliable information. For instance, SCOPE reduces the chances for human errors in data collection and reporting, because it is paperless. Everything is automated and cross-checked in the electronic system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also ensures real-time performance tracking, which helps our team initiate &#8220;course corrections&#8221; to the programme design and improves adherence to corporate standards and donor reporting.</p>
<p>The Government of Malawi has been involved in training and data collection. This is also helping the Government to learn more about attendance of women and children at health centres and about their participation.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Did you know?</h4>
<p style="color:#666;">In Ntchisi, almost half of all children under two are stunted, with 47 percent also the rate across the whole of Malawi.</p>
</div>
<p>Next steps will be to complement SCOPE with mobile technology, whereby we send vouchers and validate them via SMS. In addition, plans are in place to use mobile phones for beneficiary registration, making the process simpler for NGOs, governments and other UN partners.</p>
<p>The real &#8220;value added&#8221; of SCOPE is that it allows us to be more accountable to our beneficiaries, thanks to the accurate and immediate availability of information. Not only are we able to improve activities like food management, but we are also able to improve elements like beneficiary targeting – ensuring that our assistance is reaching the right people at the right time to make the greatest impact. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>&#8216;This change is really happening&#8217;</h3>
<p>Working with SCOPE has been a great opportunity for professional development, helping me gain expertise in database management, information systems and equipment by working closely with IT specialists. By being part of this process, I have realized that WFP will increasingly need standardized and quickly deployable tools like SCOPE to deliver effective food assistance. This is especially true for emergencies and as we scale up market-based responses to food insecurity.</p>

<p>When I joined WFP in 2008, I would never have predicted the largest humanitarian agency in the world adopting such a sophisticated level of technology, but this change is really happening – and it is happening fast. For me, systems like SCOPE represent the real future for WFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am proud that we have the opportunity to pilot the system in Malawi. Using an IT platform that is at the forefront of humanitarian innovation inspires me in my work every day.</p>
