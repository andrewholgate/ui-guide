			<p>To get <em>Myriad Pro</em> &amp; <em>FF Meta Serif Web Pro</em>, you need to load them from <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a>. WFP has its own official font kit, which you can use freely on any subdomain of <em>wfp.org</em>, by implementing the code outlined below just before the closing <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag of your website:</p>

			<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//use.typekit.net/xxxxxxx.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;try{Typekit.load();}catch(e){}&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

			<p>However, if your web domain doesn't fall into *.wfp.org wildcard, please contact our Communications Division, to get your domain approved for use with our official kit.</p>

			<h3 class="section-title">Headings</h3>
			<p>Headings are a useful tool to markup important sections of a given page, such as headlines, chapters, etc. Any heading elements may include links or anchors.</p>

			<div class="type-sizes headings">
	      <h4 class="label">H1</h4>
	      <h1 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h1>
	      <h4 class="label">H2</h4>
	      <h2 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h2>
	      <h4 class="label">H3</h4>
	      <h3 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h3>
	      <h4 class="label">H4</h4>
	      <h4 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h4>
	      <h4 class="label">H5</h4>
	      <h5 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h5>
	      <h4 class="label">H6</h4>
	      <h6 class="example">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h6>
	    </div>

			<h3 class="section-title">Links</h3>
			<p>Links are special elements that point reader to other places on the Web, therefore they have to stand out from other text. Use only meaningful text for your links; words such as "here", "click here" don't tell the reader where they lead.</p>

			<div class="preview paragraph">
				<p>The Zero Hunger Challenge, launched by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, encourages everyone - whether in government, business or civil society - to focus their energies on ending hunger in our lifetimes. By partnering with WFP and supporting its work, major global companies such as <a href="https://www.wfp.org/how-to-help/companies/partner/unilever">Unilever</a>, <a href="https://www.wfp.org/partners/private-sector/meet-our-partners/dsm">DSM</a> and <a href="https://www.wfp.org/about/partners/companies/meet-our-partners/mastercard">MasterCard</a> have already started to do this, joining with <a href="https://www.wfp.org/partners/governments"></a>governments</a> and civil society in the quest for zero hunger.</p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="section-title">Blockquotes</h3>
			<p>Whenever you need to use a quote from another source on your page, use a <code>blockquote</code> tag.</p>

			<div class="preview paragraph">
				<blockquote>The Zero Hunger Challenge, launched by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, encourages everyone - whether in government, business or civil society - to focus their energies on ending hunger in our lifetimes.
